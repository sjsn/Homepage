		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
		<div id="important">
			<p>
				I understand that I (the user) am enjoying this free-to-use website and will abide by
				the terms and conditions set forth by this page. If I violate any of these terms,
				I am held liable for any consequences that may happen.

		<h2>Usernames and Password</h2>
		<p>
			Although not required, it is recommended that I create my own username and password.
			The shared username (test) and password (test1234) have unmanaged and unwatched
			contents. In creating my own username and password, I understand that the creator 
			and/or anyone with access to this webservice (homepage) and a rudimentary 
			understanding of file structures can view my username and password at any time. 
			Therefore, I understand that I should use an uncommon username and password to myself
			and not something that the creator could abuse, either intentionally or accidentally,
			in the future.
		</p>
		<h2>Sessions/Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			I understand that this web service intalls and utilizes non-malicious cookies/sessions
			to store login information to improve the services and customizability that the 
			website offers. These can be cleared anytime from the browsers settings menu, but
			upon doing so, may delete said customizations and services.
