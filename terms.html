			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			<div id="important">
				<p>
					I understand that I (the user, me) am enjoying this free-to-use website and will abide by
					the terms and conditions set forth by this page. If I violate any of these terms,
					I am held liable for any consequences that may happen.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>In Development</h2>
			<p>
				I understand that this website is currently in development and any account that I create,
				data that I input, or settings that I save may be deleted at any time by the developer.
			</p>
			<h2>Usernames and Password</h2>
			<p>
				Although not required, it is recommended that I create my own username and password.
				The shared username (test) and password (test1234) have unmanaged and unwatched
				contents. In creating my own username and password, I understand that the creator 
				and/or anyone with access to this webservice (homepage) and a rudimentary 
				understanding of file structures can view my username and password at any time. 
				Therefore, I understand that I should use an uncommon username and password to myself
				and not something that the creator could abuse, either intentionally or accidentally,
				in the future.
			</p>
			<h2>Sessions/Cookies</h2>
			<p>
				I understand that this web service intalls and utilizes non-malicious cookies/sessions
				to store login information to improve the services and customizability that the 
				website offers. These can be cleared anytime from the browsers settings menu, but
				upon doing so, may delete said customizations and services.
			</p>
			<h2>Location Information</h2>
			<p>
				I understand that this website allows me to customize my location information to display
				weather data relevant to me. That information will not intentionally be shared or accessed
				directly at any time by the developer. If I choose to opt-out of setting my location 
				information, it will default to imperial units, Seattle, Washington, United States, 98105.
