# Homepage
An informative homepage for any browser.

Available on [my student webspace](http://students.washington.edu/sjsn/homepage/).

## What is it?

Homepage is a fun project I created that can act as the homepage for any computer or mobile device through a browser. At Homepage, the user can see relevant weather data, view a customizable ToDo list, and *see a calendar* (not yet implemented).

## What it's built on

Just to get started, I have built the front end simply through HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the backend on php. However, I plan on rebuilding the front end using angular.js and the back end on Node.js.

## What's to come?

Bug fixes, new features, and more!
